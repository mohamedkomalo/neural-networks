# Neural Networks
Implementation of various neural networks for my Neural Network course.

The purpose of providing the code is that we didn't have a model answer for the assignments and most of the class wasn't able to code a correct neural network or even understand what they coded (including me).

So this is an attempt to provide some kind of reference answer with comments to clarify it.

However, copying the code will not benefit you at all. I had lots of fatal programming mistakes (like integer division when the return is double). You are strongly encouraged to try to do your implementation on your own. As I said, this is provided more as a reference answer.

## Currently implemented
### Back-propagation neural network
the input and output were generated from set of monochromatic bitmap that represents the numbers (1, 3, 9). 
The output (0 0 1) represents 1
The output (0 1 0) represents 3
The output (1 0 0) represents 9
The test file use the same data from the train file. You can remove some of the data from the train file and only test on these data.
 

The neural networks implemented maybe inefficient and are not strongly tested, use them with cautions.
